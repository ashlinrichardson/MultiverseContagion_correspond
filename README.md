```
python3 write_csv_run.py # use this to generate multiple runs of CovidSIM
```

```
python3 plot_density.py # generate density plot and calculate mean trajectory
```

```
python3 fit_sir.py # fit SIR model to mean trajectory
```

## Todo:

* fit CovidSIM to SIR
* derive mapping from coefficient sets (both directions)


## Done
* fit SIR to CovidSIM
* fit_sir.py read params from param.csv (sortof, we read the pop size and the initial number of infected)
